# Udaci-Cards

by Bradley Wittenbrook

This project is the final project as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).


## Getting Started

```
yarn install
```

Installs project dependencies, and prepares the application.


```
yarn start
```

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
